**Welcome to the GitHub repository of our freeware aircraft, the Boeing 777, for Microsoft Flight Simulator!**

## About

In February of 2021, we annouced our free project called the PPS 777 (Pinpoint Simulations 777) which is based off the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft. We plan to make the entire 777 family after we make the debut of the 777-300ER. Additionally, our project is open-source, which means *you* can contribute to the project in a multitude of different ways!

## Download

As we progress further into a state to test the aircraft, we want to show you how to build the plane in Microsoft Flight Simulator using these steps:

- Download the Repository
- Extract the PPS777 folder to a suitable location (Not your community folder)
- Enable Development Mode in MSFS (If you need help, [click here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLcUhRvRw_U)
- On the development bar at the top of your MSFS window, Click [Dev Mode] > Open Project. Select PinpointB77 > Pinpoint777Project.xml
- From the Command Prompt, (Type CMD in the start menu), run the commands npm i, and npm run build, in the PinpointB777 folder, this generates the display files from src. (You must have [npm/node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed)
- In the development bar at the top of MSFS, Open Tools > Project Editor, and click build all.
- Once the build is complete, the B777 will appear in your available aircraft list.

**Some parts of the aircraft may be missing or invalid because we haven't finalized everything. This build is NOT the final product, and is only for fun.**
After this, if you feel like many parts are missing, or the plane behaves incorrectly, open an [issue here](https://github.com/Pinpoint-Simulations/PPS777/issues) and we'll help you as much to our advantage.
